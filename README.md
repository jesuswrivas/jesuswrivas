### RoR Developer 


Greetings, visitor,

I'm Jesus Rivas, an Electrical Engineer with a passion for technology. I've earned my stripes as Technology and Automation Specialist in the mining industry of Peru: Haul traucks, Giant Shovels, Drilling Rigs, you name it.

Currently, I'm seeking new challenges as a Junior Developer. I've got the fundamentals covered (HTML, CSS, JS, OOP Principles, TDD..., etc.), Ruby, RoR, and have experience testing units using RSPEC and deployments on a Linode server. My knowledge extends to databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Windows SQL Server, and managing Linux servers. Additionally, throughout my EE career, I've acquired skills in Python, MATLAB, Pascal, VB, and PLC's.

I am a seasoned professional with good judgment and strong soft skills, ready to tackle any challenge.
